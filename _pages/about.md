# About Me

HiðŸ‘‹! My name is Falong Fan, a first-year PhD student at [Eletrical & Computer Engineering Department](https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu/) at [University of Arizona (UofA)](https://www.arizona.edu/), under supervision of [Prof. Bo Liu](https://ergodicmarkovian.github.io/main/). My research interests lie at artificial intelligence, specifically at multi-agent system and their applications, such as healthcare and robustness. 

Before starting my PhD journey at UofA, I earned my Masters' degree in [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), advised by [Prof. Ruimao Zhang](http://zhangruimao.site/). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelors' in [University of Science and Technology Beijing](https://en.ustb.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. Sen Wu. In non-academic contexts, I am into cooking, sports such as badminton, swimming and gym.
